# Laptop Price Predictor

## Description
The Laptop Price Predictor project is designed to predict the prices of laptops based on various features using regression algorithms. This project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, which has been selected for deployment due to its superior performance. Details of the algorithm's evaluation can be found in the colab notebook (.ipynb) included in the repository.

## Demo
You can see the live demo of the project deployed using Streamlit [here](laptoppricepredictor00byatharv-mzjy2pfud9jjbyme4u9wix.streamlit.app).

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Usage
1. Open the deployed app or run it locally as described below.
2. Input the features of the laptop you want to predict the price for.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to see the estimated price.

## Features
- Predicts laptop prices based on various input features.
- Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for deployment.
- Evaluation and selection of the algorithm can be found in the included colab notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the repository.

## Data Considerations
Please note that the data used for this model is somewhat outdated, and laptop prices may vary significantly with current market trends. Ensure to consider this while interpreting the predictions.

## Learning Experience
Creating this project involved:
- Understanding and applying various regression algorithms.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Deploying a machine learning model using Streamlit.
